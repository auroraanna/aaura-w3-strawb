Before this project, Anna Aurora's website was a bunch of static files, mostly generated by a static site generator. This project rewrites Anna Aurora's website as a dynamic webserver. This allows avoiding JavaScript on some routes it was previously needed on and gives Anna more freedom over the structure and design of her website's source code.

| `src`         | All the source code for the webserver resides here.                                                                                                                                     |
| `static`      | These files are served directly with no processing except if applicable, compression.                                                                                                   |
| `markdown`    | Contains markdown files which are processed into html at runtime of the webserver. Other files in here are served statically or are media that is processed by one of the nix packages. |
| `pkgs`        | Nix derivations containing instructions on how to compile the webserver and process files to be served statically, made into Nix packages.                                              |
| `modules`     | NixOS modules for sysadmins to host the webserver in a hardened systemd service.                                                                                                        |
