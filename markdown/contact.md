<strong>To anonymously, urgently and confidentially disclose security vulnerabilities in my services, send a message to <span class="mono">https://ntfy.annaaurora.eu/security-vuln</span> <a href="https://ntfy.annaaurora.eu/docs/publish/">like this</a>.</strong>

## end-to-end encrypted by default

These contact options are generally preferred for private conversations because they make end-to-end encryption convenient. For the other private contact options that are not end-to-end encrypted by default, if you don't want service providers to be able to read the messages, encrypt to [my public PGP key](#pgp-key) or [my public age key](#age-key). age might be preferred for convenience and simplicity.

### matrix

A good way to contact me is [matrix](https://matrix.org/). My MXID is [@annaaurora:artemislena.eu](https://matrix.to/#/@annaaurora:artemislena.eu). If you don't have an account yet, please don't register on matrix.org. It defeats the decentralization. Instead, have a look at [this list e.g.](https://github.com/techlore/faq-bot/blob/6c257e35c9033de7222be16528f3ab39a466b56a/faq.json#L10) or use the matrix server of someone you know. I'm sure there's many more nice homeservers out there.

### SimpleX Chat

[SimpleX Chat](https://simplex.chat/) is a pretty new messenger that fixes some problems with other privacy and security oriented messengers. You can be anonymous with it. Currently, there is just a client for Android and iOS phones and a terminal client. To contact me if you have the app installed, [open this contact link](https://simplex.chat/contact#/?v=2-5&smp=smp%3A%2F%2F6iIcWT_dF2zN_w5xzZEY7HI2Prbh3ldP07YTyDexPjE%3D%40smp10.simplex.im%2FA8yjzq7FCXURRlKKHk0pSVWeawtZGgDN%23%2F%3Fv%3D1-2%26dh%3DMCowBQYDK2VuAyEA-KlVDK1JtuB6EpcXW-EzqrIRI250ek0fxiL7wj8TLDM%253D%26srv%3Drb2pbttocvnbrngnwziclp2f4ckjq65kebafws6g4hy22cdaiv5dwjqd.onion).

## Report issues with this website

You can publicly report issues with this website in [it's source code repository's issues on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/annaaurora/aaura-w3-strawb/issues). You'll need an account on Codeberg however. If you don't want to open one, use any of the others options to make me aware.

## Keyoxide

You cannot directly contact me over [my Keyoxide profile](https://keyoxide.org/E71487CE9FA30D35ED9668A6B1BDDD56BCE7CD72). However, it is useful in discovering other accounts of me and cryptographically proving that I own them.
