![A noisy image of a long dark room. There is an exit at the end of it, lighting up the room very slightly. The exit looks like a blurry mix of blue and white. On top of the image of the room there is some aesthetic monospace text, one line at the top and one line at the bottom. It's only slightler lighter than the below part of the room.](cover.png)

This has being laying in my LMMS folder for a while now. I spent a lot of time trying to add some background noise like rain or gunshots and pitchshifting them to be very low but I felt that it didn't fit so I removed it again except some rumbles at the start.
