After signing up for the [GMTK Game Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022) I felt drawn to creating some music again (I once did the music for the [Find Billy! game](https://codeberg.org/annaaurora/find-billy)).

This is my first attempt at creating music in LMMS. Before, I used Bosca Ceoil before which was nice because it was very simple and would still yield good results. It was made with Adobe AIR, which is deprecated, and I can't figure out how to get that to run on NixOS. Therefore it's kind of fading out. The dev wants to rewrite the application but doesn't know how to port the sound library to a specific newer programming language.
