![A cutout of a bedroom. It is placed on a carbon fiber floor. The bedroom includes a wooden bed with a green mattress, a metal in, a dark wooden floor, a desk, windows, a door, a monitor with keyboard and mouse and a PC behind a cactus. There are also rainbow (RGB) light a the top of the room. On top of the bed, there is a white blanket floating with a sphere under it. On the wall, the AK47 artwork from the portfolio is framed.](bedroom.webp)

Without the PBR materials from [ambientCG](https://ambientcg.com/) this would not look half as good. They're all licensed under CC0. With this piece I combined a bunch of stuff like modelling a PC and a whole bunch of other things with softbody and cloth simulations to make a nice room. I improved my compositing skills quite a bit too. All the work took several days though the time was probably greatly reduced by my *new* hardware like a better processor and graphics card.
