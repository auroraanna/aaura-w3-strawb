I found this song in the list of songs I started and then I started to complete it. It also led to me making [a Nix flake](https://codeberg.org/annaaurora/Lyrically-Vantage/src/branch/main/flake.nix) to reproducibly and automatically build this song from [the LMMS file](Lyrically%20Vantage.mmpz) and the Blender cover art file.

It's a slow instrumental song made purely with digital instruments including a choir, a cathedral organ and a fantasy bell piano. The song is a bit heavy and dramatic but also playful.
