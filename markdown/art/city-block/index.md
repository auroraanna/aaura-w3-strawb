![A floating low-poly square of a tiny part of a city. The buildings have roofs with plants and solar panels. Between the buildings is a black road. Under the floor, the sediments are shown in slightly different colors.](city-block.webp)

Created in Blender and rendered with it's Eevee engine. For the modelling I had inspiration from [Imphenzia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewKwYsQjBdQ).
