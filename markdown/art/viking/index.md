![Everything except out of focus background is in a low-poly style. There is a Viking standing on a floating ball of dirt, grass and snow. Is is snowing. The viking is looking in the distance behind the camera, his hand on his left hand of his forehead and his right hand on his hips. He is wearing a sword on his back. Orange is the hair color of his beard and bun on the top of his head.](viking.webp)

With this low-poly viking I learned more about rigging in 3d-software. I used Blender with the Cycles engine.
